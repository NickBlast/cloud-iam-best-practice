This process outlines how to assign a **synchronized on-premises Active Directory group** (visible in Microsoft Entra ID) to a built-in or custom Azure role at the correct scope (Management Group, Subscription, Resource Group, or Resource).  
The goal is to ensure role assignments follow least-privilege principles and are properly documented for audit and review.
