## **IAM Engineer – Day-to-Day Summary (Executive Overview)**

### **Core Responsibilities**

* **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):**
  Review and approve Terraform PRs to enforce secure IAM policy design and least privilege.

* **Federation & SSO Triage:**
  Diagnose and resolve identity issues across multi-cloud and multi-IdP environments.

* **Secrets Management:**
  Operate and troubleshoot automated secrets rotation (e.g., AWS Secrets Manager) to prevent credential leaks.

* **Access Review Campaigns:**
  Support identity governance tools (SailPoint, Entra ID) to maintain compliance and validate user access.

* **Monitoring & Metrics:**
  Build dashboards and alerts (e.g., Splunk) to monitor identity activity, track KPIs, and detect threats.

---

### **Proactive Security Initiatives**

* **Shift-Left with IaC:**
  Embed IAM policies in development pipelines to prevent misconfigurations pre-deployment.

* **Automation First:**
  Streamline access provisioning, reviews, and secrets rotation to reduce manual effort and errors.

* **Policy-as-Code:**
  Enforce real-time compliance using tools like OPA/Sentinel as gatekeepers in deployment pipelines.

* **Secure-by-Design Reviews:**
  Integrate IAM best practices early in app and infra design to reduce future identity risk.

* **Continuous Improvement:**
  Refine IAM processes using real-time data, threat modeling, and policy optimization.

### **Strategic Impact**

* Reduces reactive firefighting through automation and early security embedding
* Enhances regulatory compliance and audit readiness
* Enables IAM engineers to focus on threat modeling, architecture, and resilience planning
