# üõ°Ô∏è IAM Cloud Program Growth Roadmap

## Overview
This document outlines a phased roadmap to guide the development and scaling of the IAM cloud engineering program within a multi-cloud enterprise context. The roadmap provides a strategy for a two-person IAM engineering team to support current priorities, guide future hiring, and establish an enterprise-class IAM function aligned to compliance (FFIEC CAT, NIST 800-53, CSA STAR).

It is intended for leadership visibility and to be documented in Confluence as a strategic guidepost.

## üéØ Mission Statement
To design, standardize, and scale an enterprise-grade IAM function that secures identity and access across AWS, Azure/Entra, and GCP, supports DevSecOps, and enables business agility while maintaining regulatory compliance.

---

## üöÄ Phase 1: Stabilization & Foundation (Q3 2025 ‚Äì End of 2025)
**Goal:** Establish standards, visibility, and core control enforcement for Azure/Entra and AWS.

### üîπ Azure Landing Zone Support
- Document all IAM access flows and resource provisioning in Confluence
- Build IaC modules (Terraform) for roles, groups, service principals
- Refactor existing technical debt (hard-coded permissions, legacy groups)
- Map IAM resources to applications + owners (CMDB mapping)
- Implement Confluence-based IAM resource knowledge base
- Define process for cross-tenant access and M365 API access control
- Establish baseline certification process for Entra roles + app registrations

### üîπ AWS Landing Zone Design Support
- Participate in LZ design and legacy gap analysis (IAM 1.0 ‚Üí 2.0)
- Define standards for new AWS IAM roles, policies, service accounts
- Migrate IAM Terraform modules and assist with remote state management
- Map AWS IAM entities to owners + applications
- Begin building compliance visibility dashboards (Splunk, tagging, manual scripting)

### üîπ Cross-Initiatives
- Document all authentication flows (Ping + Okta) in Confluence
- Begin code reviews + repository structuring for all IAM terraform repos
- Build ad hoc PowerShell + CLI scripts for IAM analysis
- Establish baseline tagging, ownership, and certification requirements

---

## üèóÔ∏è Phase 2: Automation & Observability (2026 ‚Äì Q2 2026)
**Goal:** Improve efficiency, transparency, and policy enforcement across clouds.

### üîπ Central Inventory + Dashboard Development
- Build internal dashboards for IAM resource tracking and non-compliance
- Integrate data from:
  - Veza (once onboarded)
  - SailPoint (source of truth)
  - Wiz (via API)
  - CyberArk (manual mapping)
  - ServiceNow CMDB
  - Splunk (audit logs)
- Correlate roles, service accounts, permissions, and ownership

### üîπ Compliance Automation + Certification
- Automate tagging audits and owner mapping validation
- Integrate SailPoint + ServiceNow for re-certification workflow
- Define rules for policy scope and risk scoring
- Develop drift detection tooling for IAM entities vs. Terraform

### üîπ Okta Migration Finalization
- Support testing, federation integration, and cutover of AWS to Okta
- Document post-migration operational workflows
- Partner with federation team on secrets rotation and assertion validation

---

## üåê Phase 3: Scaling + Governance as Code (Q3 2026 and Beyond)
**Goal:** Harden IAM as a product. Scale with security, DevSecOps integration, and predictive compliance.

### üîπ IAM as Code Maturity
- Formalize versioned IAM modules (per cloud)
- Enforce policy-as-code for tagging, ownership, role scope
- Introduce CI/CD checks for IAM Terraform PRs
- Implement self-service JIT model via SailPoint or Okta Workflows

### üîπ Organizational Scaling
- Define hiring roadmap:
  - IAM Cloud Engineer (Terraform + tooling)
  - IAM Operations Engineer (certification + support)
  - IAM Architect (future-state design + tool ownership)
- Embed IAM engineers in cloud/platform working groups
- Create IAM steering council to govern policy exceptions, drift response, JIT eligibility

### üîπ Long-Term Analytics & Insights
- Build behavioral models for privilege scoring (based on usage)
- Use AI/LLM agents to correlate IAM risks across cloud, CMDB, and SIEM
- Enable dashboard exports for audit readiness + executive reporting

---

## ‚úÖ Success Metrics
- 100% of IAM resources mapped to app + owner
- 100% of Terraform modules reviewed + versioned
- All IAM access flows documented in Confluence
- <5% IAM resource drift across platforms
- SLA-driven access certification cadence in place

---

> This roadmap will evolve quarterly and be version-controlled in Confluence.
> It acts as the foundation for IAM team scaling, hiring, tooling adoption, and engineering prioritization.
