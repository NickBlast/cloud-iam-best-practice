* Lead policy-as-code enforcement, JIT access enablement, and cross-cloud federation modernization.

**Key Deliverables:**

* Design and implement RBAC/ABAC models across cloud platforms, federating via Okta and migrating AWS from Ping → Okta.

* Author Terraform modules for cloud IAM: roles, policies, service accounts; integrate gating via OPA, Checkov, or Sentinel.

* Automate secrets lifecycle: auto-rotation in AWS Secrets Manager, Key Vault, Secret Manager, and CyberArk via IaC.

* Configure JIT access: SailPoint-based workflows, Azure PIM, time-bound role elevation, and approval logic.

* Onboard Veza for identity posture visibility; build dashboards and feedback loops for continuous least-privilege enforcement.

* Oversee Splunk integration: ingest IdP, IAM, and secrets access logs; build IAM-specific dashboards and alerting.

**Skills & Qualifications:**

* 5–8 years IAM experience, with multi-cloud hands-on work (AWS, Azure/Entra, GCP).

* Strong knowledge of SailPoint IdentityIQ, Okta, Ping Identity, CyberArk.

* Deep federation experience: SAML 2.0, OIDC, OAuth; service-to-service federation (OIDC, Roles Anywhere, Workload Identity Federation).

* Proficiency in Terraform; expertise in PaC tools (OPA, Rego, Sentinel, Conftest).

* Scripting: Python, PowerShell, Bash.

* Familiarity with compliance frameworks: NIST 800‑53, FFIEC, CSA STAR, SOX, GDPR.

* Excellent communication and mentorship skills for working with architects and executives.

**Leadership Qualities:**

* Takes strategic ownership, mentors junior engineers.

* Advocates for security-first, automation-first culture.

* Communicates complex technical topics clearly to stakeholders and executives.

**Collaboration:**

* Works cross-functionally with Cloud Architects, Security Ops, DevOps, Comms, and Compliance teams.

 You will join our expanding IAM Cloud team supporting identity infrastructure across AWS, Azure and GCP. The role is deeply technical, hands-on, and pivotal in enabling automation, compliance, and secure identity governance.

**Impact:**

* Implement critical parts of the multi-cloud IAM program—Terraform pipelines, federation flows, JIT access onboarding.

* Support pilot projects like Veza onboarding, Azure IaC kickoff, and secrets rotation automation.

* Help reduce privilege shadows by integrating telemetry-driven role reviews and access certification campaigns.

**Key Deliverables:**

* Implement Terraform-based IAM resources: roles/policies/service accounts for AWS, Azure, GCP.

* Script automation integrations (Python/PowerShell) for user/service provisioning, secrets syncing, and CMDB tagging.

* Assist in enabling JIT via SailPoint and Azure PIM; support pilot elevated access workflows.

* Support compliance automation: tag enforcement, least-privilege validation, drift detection triggers.

* Help onboard Veza and assist with dashboards that visualize identity metrics and excess privilege signals.
